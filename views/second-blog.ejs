                One of the best things you can do in the world is coding.

What is coding? And how to get started?
Coding is the act of writing code, and the result of coding is a program. The one who codes the program is called a coder or a programmer.

If you are new into the arena of the programming world, then I suggest that you begin with Web Development. Programming can be daunting and requires a lot of patience. But web development is something that you can start slow and the joy of building and seeing your projects will keep you motivated.

Being a self-taught programmer, I myself started with Web Development, and have been doing it since the past 2 years. And I can tell you with all my sincerity that I have been loving it. I have developed personal numerous projects which have helped me land a job as a web developer without any prior experience or any degree in Computer Science. Yes, you heard that right!

To motivate all the self-learning programmers out there, I am here to share my experience with you on how I started with Web Development. 

Any web application will consist of front end and back end. Front-end is the user interface that the user can see and used it to interact with the application. The back-end is where the main business logic is implemented. The back-end consists of a server, application, database, frameworks, etc. This is hidden from the user. 

To build Web Applications, we need the desired tools and here is how you can start. We will be using MERN (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack to develop our web application:
Front-end Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Back-end Technologies: PL-SQL/NoSQL, ReactJs, NodeJS.
Frameworks: Bootstrap, ExpressJs
IDE: Atom/VS Code

After learning HTML and CSS, look everything around the web and think about how you can create the same look and feel using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

After building the layout of the web application, we need to add functionalities for it to work. For that, we will be using JS.
Learn how to select something in javascript.
Learn how to manipulate DOM.
Learn to create functions
Javascript Data Structure.
How to manipulate data.
Learn the Array & Object Method
Then start creating projects, anything that you can see on the web which you can create only using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Using these technologies and using a website as a reference, start building your website. Remember to start small and eventually keep adding functionalities as you go on.

After having successfully built the front end, you can dive right into the backend. But that is a topic for another article.

Until then, I hope this article clears the concept regarding the front-end.

Thank You.
